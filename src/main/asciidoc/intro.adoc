https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases[Ehcache 3] has been released!  In this post I would like to demonstrate how to use it as Spring's caching implementation.  This article will show you how to use https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3[Ehcache 3.0], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/[Spring 4.2] and the https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107] annotations to build a simple Spring web application.  I have also included some background reading for those of you that would like to read more in depth on the subject matter.
